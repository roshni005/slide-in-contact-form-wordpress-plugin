# slide-in-contact-form-wordpress-plugin
SlideIn Form is a combination of  plugins with some minor customizations used to show enquiry box on fixed position like bottom, left or right side with CSS3 effects for visitors.

To start collecting names and email addresses of visitors to your blog pages, so that visitors can leave their details. The form needs to be basic and inobstrusive – including only a first name, last name and email address field – and having a “slide-in” effect. The collected information should be shown as a table within the WordPress admin area. The icon should be editable with admins able to select any of the Font Awesome icons (https://fontawesome.com/), and select their own background and font colour for the form. The only items that are non-negotiable are that: a. there must be a recaptcha to prevent spam b. the slide-in must show after 10s to every first time visitor on the first page they land but thereafter, it should NOT slide-in automatically for the session, or for a future session for the next 3 days
